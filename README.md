# Bayesian Statistics Short Course - Week 2 Workshop


This repository contains the files and instructions you need to get started. 

Please click on the `clone or download` button above and download the zip file containing the data and code you will need. Extract the files into your mydocuments directory.

# Winbugs

You will also need to install winbugs. This can be obtained from the winbugs [home page](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/the-bugs-project-winbugs/). Due to installation restrictions on university machines, it is probably best to (download the zipped version of the whole file structure)[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/winbugs14_unrestricted.zip] and unzip it to your mydocuments folder. This will also make it easier to connect to R later.

## Openbugs
Openbugs is an opensource implementation of bugs which is better maintained, but is more difficult to install without admin rights, so we will be using winbugs today.


# R and Rstudio
R should be installed on your machine along with Rstudio, the development environment for R. 

# Homework
The material for the homework for weeks one and two is now included in this repository, in the folders `Week_1_material` and `Week_2_homework`.
